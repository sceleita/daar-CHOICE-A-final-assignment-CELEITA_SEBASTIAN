Make sure you copy all the .txt files into */books* existing folder in the project directory

### Install Docker
Depending on your local host system please follow the instructions as suggested in:
- Install Docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
- Install Docker Compose - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### Build Application Container
Run the wollowing command, it will take a while to download the image and dependencies to customize it:

    docker-compose build
You should see:

    frontend uses an image, skipping
    elasticsearch uses an image, skipping

### Launch full application stack
Run the following command, This step might take a few minutes since Docker has to download the base images for each container:

    docker-compose up
You should see:

    Creating network "daar-choice-a-final-assignment-celeita_sebastian_default" with the default driver
    Creating volume "daar-choice-a-final-assignment-celeita_sebastian_esdata" with default driver
    Creating gs-search   ... done
    Creating gs-api      ... done
    Creating gs-frontend ... done
    Attaching to gs-frontend, gs-api, gs-search

### Load data into Elasticsearch
Check the connection via HTTP http://localhost:9200/_cat/health?v you should see something like:

    epoch      timestamp cluster        status node.total node.data shards pri relo init unassign pending_tasks max_task_wait_time active_shards_percent
    1643981011 13:23:31  docker-cluster yellow          1         1      8   8    0    0        8             0                  -                 50.0%
Run the following command to upload all documents in */books* to the Datastore Elasticsearch instance:

    docker exec gs-api "node" "server/load_data.js"

It should start uploading files:

    $ docker exec gs-api "node" "server/load_data.js"
    Connecting to ES
    { cluster_name: 'docker-cluster',
      status: 'yellow',

### Search directly to Datastore
For the purpose of this project, the Elasticsearch interface is exposed to the Docker client
meaning that a direct search can be done via HTTP with a JSON respons.
Try in the web browser http://localhost:9200/library/_search?q=text:Sargon&pretty

You should get:
![ES_search](./img/ES_search.png)

### UI Book search engine
As a final user, we can access to the book search engine via HTTP to the NGINX container service
http://localhost:8080/

By default the application will try to find the word Sargon:
![UI1](./img/UI_1.png)

You can explore each book in the paragraph that has matched the search query:
![UI2](./img/UI_2.png)

### Changes and updates
If you have done any change and want to redeploy the stack to push the updates, run the following command:

    docker-compose up -d --build
